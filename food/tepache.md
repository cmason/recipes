## Ingredients

- Pineapple peels
- 1 cup of Piloncillo cut in pieces or use brown sugar
- 1 stick of cinnamon (optional)
- 3 cloves (optional)
- 2 quarts of filtered water

## Preperation

1. Rinse the pineapple and using a sharp knife to cut the peel and slice or chop the pineapple pulp. You are not using all the pineapple unless you have a large glass container to make a bigger batch.
1. In a large glass pitcher, place the pineapple peels, the piloncillo or sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves and the 2 quarts of water.
1. Cover the pitcher or glass container with a cheesecloth or a plastic wrap in a loose manner that allows the brew to breathe. Place this container in your countertop and let it sit for 24 for hours. (If you do not have A/C and live in a very hot place, then check after 12 hrs.) With a wooden spoon, remove the white foam that has formed on top of the liquid. Loosely cover again an let rest for another 24 to 36 hrs., DO NOT let it ferment longer unless you need pineapple vinegar to make pickled chipotle peppers.
1. Strain the liquid of your pitcher and place in another pitcher with lots of ice. Taste for sweetness in case it needs more sugar for your taste. If you prefer a milder version, add 1 cup of the fermented pineapple water to 1 quarter cup of water.
