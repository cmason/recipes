# Tuica Recipe (ˈt͡sujkə)

Fruits – leave in a container for 3-4 weeks to ferment. When there is liquid at the bottom of the container it means it’s fermented enough. Some people add sugar to the fruits to ferment more so you get more yield for the same amount of fruits. If adding sugar it’s added a very thin layer on top of the fruits. My godfather does not do that.

Original recipe is with plums (whole). Other people use pears but they may need to be cut in four to help ferment. Other people use the crushed grapes and stems from making wine – this gives you grappa (Italian version of tuica).
Use distiller (make sure there is a screen to keep the fruits from sticking to the bottom of the distilling pot when boiling). Do not fill to the brim of the boiling pot. I’d say fill to ¾ to make sure the boiling fruits don’t make it through the umbilical.
Distill and watch alcohol content -  use a floating alcoholmeter or hydrometer in the pot where the distilled liquid comes out. Target is 25-30% ABV / 50-60 proof this is a personal choice. My parents make it to 26% - 52 proof.

Taste a bit and stop if bitter taste shows up or pure water. Alcohol content decreases as the distilling process takes place so you have very strong at the beginning and very light to no alcohol at the end. The alcoholmeter helps getting a consistent alcohol content between batches.

In Transylvania they make it stronger by double distilling. North of Romania they tripe distill to 85% volume. It’s drank in shot glasses with raw bacon otherwise it burns your throat – don’t ask me how I know.
