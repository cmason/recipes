# Clarified Bacon Fat

* 1 cup rendered bacon fat
* 2 cups cold water, divided

Strain rendered bacon fat through a fine mesh strainer into a saucepan. Add 1 cup of water and bring 
to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and gently boil for 1-2 minutes. Transfer to heat-proof
container and add remaining cup of water. Refrigerate for at least 5 hours until the fat has solidified,
or freeze for 2 hours. The mixture will separate into a layer of clarified fat and a layer of water mixed
with impurities. Remove the solidified fat and discard the water. Place fat in airtight container and store
in the refrigerator for up to 1 month, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.
