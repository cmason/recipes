# Coffee Cake

## Batter

* 1 egg, beaten slightly
* 2 Tbs melted shortening
* 1/2 cup of milk
* 1/2 cup of sugar
* 1 cup sifted flour
* 1/2 Tsp salt
* 2 Tsp baking powder

## Topping
* 1/4 Tsp cinnamon
* 1/16 Tsp allspice
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 Tbs butter

Start oven at moderate (375 deg F). Grease 8in square pan. Combine egg, shortening, milk, and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add flour, salt, and baking powder sifted together. Mix well. Pour into prepared pan. Bake 20 minutes.

While cake bakes, mix the toppings: combine cinnamon, allspice, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup flour in a small bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender. Mix well. Spread on cake just before pulling out of the oven. You can broil for a minute or so to get extra cruchy top.
