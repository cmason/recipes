# Laundry Soap

Making your own laundry soap is significantly less expensive than buying in the store and it is really simple to make.
This recipe makes 2 gallons (approximately 64 loads) and works just fine with HE washing machines.

## Tools
- Bucket (slightly bigger than 2 gallons)
- Wooden spoon with a long handle
- Sauce pan
- Cheese grater
- Drill with paint mixer (optional)

## Ingredients

- 1/2 bar of Fels Naptha or Zote soap (you can use Ivory, but use the whole bar)
- 1/2 cup of Arm & Hammer Washing Soda
- 1/2 cup of 20 Mule Team Borax Powder

## Preparation

Grate the soap and put it in the sauce pan. Add 6 cups of water and heat it until the soap melts.
Add the washing soda and borax powder and stir until it is dissolved. Remove from heat. Pour 4 cups
of hot water into the bucket. Now add the soap mixture and stir. Add 1 gallon plus 6 cups of water and
stir some more. If you want your soap to have some kind of scent, you can add 1/2 to 1 oz. of essential oil
to the mix. Orange oil or peppermint oil works nicely.

Now let the soap sit for about 24 hours to gel. After the soap has gelled, mix it again until it is the consistency
of egg noodle soup. Use a drill with a paint mixer to speed up the process. After it has been thoroughly mixed pour
into container(s) with lids (old laundry detergent containers work well).

Use 1/2 cup per load of laundry and give the container a good shaking before pouring.
